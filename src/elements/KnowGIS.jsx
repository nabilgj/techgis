                      A geographic information system (GIS) is a framework for
                      gathering, managing and analyzing data. Rooted in the
                      science of geography, GIS integrates many types of data.
                      It analyzes spatial location and organizes layers of
                      information into visualizations using maps and 3D scenes.
                      With this unique capability, GIS reveals deeper insights
                      into data, such as patterns, relationships, and
                      situationsâ€”helping users make smarter decisions.

                      GIS helps to set priorities based on spatial analysis. By

                    <p>
                      GIS gives people the ability to create their own digital
                      map layers to help solve real-world problems. GIS has also
                      evolved into a means for data sharing and collaboration,
                      inspiring a vision that is now rapidly becoming a
                      realityâ€”a continuous, overlapping, and interoperable GIS
                      database of the world, about virtually all subjects.
                      Today, hundreds of thousands of organizations are sharing
                      their work and creating billions of maps every day to tell
                      stories and reveal patterns, trends, and relationships
                      about everything.

                    <p>
                      With its movement to web and cloud computing, and
                      integration with real-time information via the Internet of
                      Things, GIS has become a platform relevant to almost every
                      human endeavorâ€”a nervous system of the planet. As our
                      world faces problems from expanding population, loss of
                      nature, and pollution, GIS will play an increasingly
                      important role in how we understand and address these
                      issues and provide a means for communicating solutions
                      using the common language of mapping.
